# üìä Sales and Returns Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project

## üß© Problem Statement

The company lacks a centralized, visual system to monitor and analyze its sales, returns, and customer behavior across different segments and markets. Without a comprehensive view, it's difficult to identify profitable customers, high- and low-performing products, regional sales trends, and the root causes of return orders. This limits the organization‚Äôs ability to make data-driven decisions for improving profitability, streamlining operations, and refining market strategy. The goal is to develop a Power BI dashboard to consolidate this information and uncover actionable insights.
