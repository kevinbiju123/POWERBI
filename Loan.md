## ðŸ“Š Insights from Power BI Visuals

This section summarizes key observations based on visual analysis from the Power BI dashboard.

### 1. Default Rate by Employment Type

Unemployed applicants have the highest default rate, followed by part-time and self-employed borrowers. In contrast, full-time employees and retirees exhibit the lowest default rates.

**Interpretation:**  
Employment type is a strong risk indicator. Stricter lending rules or adjusted interest rates should be applied to higher-risk employment categories such as unemployed and part-time.

### 2. Total Loan Amount by Income and Employment Type

Most of the loan volume is concentrated in middle-income full-time workers, with a secondary contribution from middle-income self-employed individuals. Low-income unemployed applicants receive the lowest loan amounts.

**Interpretation:**  
Middle-income full-time workers represent the core of the portfolio and offer both volume and stability. This group should be prioritized for product bundling and retention strategies.

### 3. Credit Score and Mortgage Status Impact on Default

Applicants with low credit scores and no mortgage show the highest default rates. Those with higher credit scores and existing mortgages are the least likely to default.

**Interpretation:**  
Creditworthiness and asset ownership (e.g., mortgages) are key predictors of repayment behavior. Loan approval models should weigh both factors and potentially require co-signers or collateral for low-score, no-asset borrowers.

### 4. Default Rate by Loan Purpose

Business and Auto loans are associated with higher default rates, while Home and Education loans exhibit more stable repayment trends.

**Interpretation:**  
Loan purpose affects risk exposure. Tighter risk assessment should be applied to Business and Auto loans, while Home and Education loans can be considered more secure for disbursing higher amounts.

---

### 5. Default Rate Over Time

Default rates peaked in 2015â€“2016, dropped in 2017, and began rising again in 2018.

**Interpretation:**  
Fluctuating risk levels over time may be influenced by economic cycles or lending policy shifts. Continuous monitoring is essential to adapt credit strategies accordingly.

---

### 6. Loan Distribution by Marital Status

Loan distribution appears balanced across Married, Single, and Divorced applicants, with no major variations in loan behavior.

**Interpretation:**  
Marital status does not significantly affect loan performance. Customer segmentation should rely more on income, credit score, and employment status.
